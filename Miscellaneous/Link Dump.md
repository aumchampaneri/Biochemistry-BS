> High resolution spatial transcriptomics is a transformative technology that enables mapping of RNA expression directly from intact tissue sections; however, its utility for the elucidation of disease processes and therapeutically actionable pathways remain largely unexplored. Here we applied Slide-seqV2 to mouse and human kidneys, in healthy and in distinct disease paradigms. First, we established the feasibility of Slide-seqV2 in human kidney by analyzing tissue from 9 distinct donors, which revealed a cell neighborhood centered around a population of LYVE1+ macrophages. Second, in a mouse model of diabetic kidney disease, we detected changes in the cellular organization of the spatially-restricted kidney filter and blood flow regulating apparatus. Third, in a mouse model of a toxic proteinopathy, we identified previously unknown, disease-specific cell neighborhoods centered around macrophages. In a spatially-restricted subpopulation of epithelial cells, we also found perturbations in 77 genes associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), including Tmed9. Treatment with a TMED9-targeting compound showed efficient removal of toxic mutant proteins and reversal of the UPR. Our studies illustrate and experimentally validate the utility of Slide-seqV2 for the discovery of disease-specific cell neighborhoods and actionable targets.

> Single-cell RNA sequencing has begun to shed light on the full cellular diversity of specific organs. However, these studies rarely examine organ-specific immune cells. Stewart et al. sequenced healthy adult and fetal kidney samples at a single-cell level to define the heterogeneity in epithelial, myeloid, and lymphoid cells. From this dataset, they identified zonation of cells, with relevance to disease and the varied perturbations that occur in different tumor settings. This profiling of the human kidney generates a comprehensive census of existing cell populations that will help inform the diagnosis and treatment of kidney-related diseases.
